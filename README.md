# SteamDotGroup

> Shortlinks for steamgroups.

## Usage

Your steamgroup URL should look like this:

    https://steamcommunity.com/groups/YourSteamGroup

You can change that to:

    https://steam.group/YourSteamGroup

That's it!  
The shortener will automatically redirect you to your steamgroup!
